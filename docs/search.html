Some key/password files were uploaded to the remote git repo. Then, git will preserve theirhistory regardless of if you delete it later (that’s what git is for). To completely eradicate it from your git history quickly and painlessly, BFG repo-cleaner1 canbe used.For arch linux, you can install the tool from AUR with yay with:  $ yay -S bfgFirst, start with deleting the unwanted files and commiting to remote as BFG won’t modify your latest commit to delete those files. Once the files are deleted, the git history can be cleaned.Next, clone the git database (.git folder) for your repo using:  $ git clone --mirror git@github.com:username/some-unclean-repo.gitNow you can run BFG-specific commands to clean your repo.To delete a file:  $ bfg --delete-files file_name some-unclean-repo.gitTo delete a folder:  $ bfg --delete-folders folder_name some-unclean-repo.gitThen, go into your folder and clean unwanted data using:  $ cd some-unclean-repo.git  $ git reflog expire --expire=now --all &amp;&amp; git gc --prune=now --aggressiveNow, you can push it to remote to have an updated clean history using git push and it is recommendedto reclone the repo for future use to prevent unwarranted pushing of dirty history.

Polybar, which is one of the popular status bars for i3wm, does not display the name of the workspace by default.The goal is to configure polybar to properly display names of workspaces which are defined in i3 configuration files.Environment:Polybar 3.4.3i3 4.18.1i3 userguide3 says that workspaces can be named by having following configuration. Configuration file for i3 is generally located at ~/.config/i3/config    bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1: name_of_workspace_1    bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2: name_of_workspace_2However, doing so will not be reflected to polybar by default. To view workspace name in the bar, further configuration of polybar module for i3 is required, which can be found at ~/.config/polybar/modules.ini.    [module/i3]    label-focused = %index% %name% Basically, the %name% placeholder which is mapped to the workspace name should be added to label-* variable which only has %index% fixing our problem.These workspaces can be further organized using assignments4 to force certain applications to be opened in specific workspace.            i3wm &#8617;              polybar &#8617;              i3 userguide &#8617;              i3 config - assignment &#8617;      ",

A basic mailto link is shown below.  &lt;a href=\"mailto:me@mysite.com\"&gt; Email me &lt;/a&gt;On clicking the link, a user’s default email client is invoked with to-address populated.Furthermore, since it is a link, parameters can be attached to specify other components of an email like subject, body, cc, bcc, etc. For a simple static sites like those created with jekyll, this type of contact forms can be used.A simple form as shown below can be used to get information from  a user.123456  &lt;form&gt;     &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" /&gt;    &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" /&gt;    &lt;textarea rows=\"5\" id=\"message\" &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;    &lt;input type=\"submit\" onclick=\"mail()\" value=\"[ submit ]\" /&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;This form will have fields for name, email and message. Special care needs to be taken with the message field if we are to preseve the text formatting. This is required because we will use Javascript for extracting the field values to create the mailto link and values extracted from these fields are not encoded for URLs; meaning spaces, newline characters, etc. are present which cannot be included in a URL. URL Encoding1 can be done with the encodeURIComponent() function available in Javascript.Following is a Javascript function that can be called for the onclick attribute of the submit button for previous form.  function mail() {    var email = document.createElement(\"a\");    email.href = \"mailto:me@mysite.com?subject=\"       + document.getElementById(\"name\").value       + \"(\" + document.getElementById(\"email\").value + \")\"      + \"&amp;body=\"      + encodeURIComponent(document.getElementById(\"message\").value);     email.click();  }Here, first an anchor (link) element is created, then its href attribute is set to a mailto link with specified to-address, subject &amp; body parameters extracted from the form (notice the call to encodeURIComponent for the message body) and finally click event is simulated for the element.This concludes the writeup. The contact form for this site is created using the same methods which can be viewed in github or by inspecting the contact page source.            HTML URL Encoding Reference &#8617;      ",
