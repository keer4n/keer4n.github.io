Today I read a lot about ceasar ciphering in [github pages][github-pages]. It was quite strenuous taking me about 5 hours to configure it and make it working fine. Merging conflicts and such to make this site work was quite frustating as I had already created a repository for the github pages online. Thanks to my binge learning. I had started from a edX course by PennX about [Data Structures and Software Design][edx-link], then went to [Big-O notation][bigo-link], then to [Markdown][markdown-link], then to [Github pages][github-pages] finally landing to [Jekyll][jekyll-link] built on ruby.  But it was worth it. I hope so.

#### Links I  followed:
1. [Data Structures and Software Design by PennX][edx-link]
2. [Big-O Notation][bigo-link]
3. [Markdown][markdown-link]
4. [Github pages][github-pages]
5. [Jekyll][jekyll-link]
6. [Jekyll-docs][jekyll-docs]
