Dealing with the whole process of applying to Graduate school is such a hassel. I had applied for a MS in CS at US for the Fall Session, 2017, but due to major hinderances and obvious slacking off, I could not attend for the season. So, I am going to apply again for the Summer Session, hopefully better prepared. So, my preparation obviously started at the front page of internet, [reddit][reddit] and after hours of really divergent links, ended at a [transcript][don-trans] of lectures given by Donald Knuth at Stanford University regarding Mathematical Writing. I think you will find the links intersting.  

#### Links I followed:
1. [Grad School advice gem at reddit][reddit]
2. [Mighty, Matt Might][matt]
3. [Mathematical Writing by Donald Knuth][don-trans] (_pdf link_)
